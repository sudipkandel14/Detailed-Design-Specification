This subsection is used when we have to save or retrieve data from the database. When user tries to login, register, add self, add item or search we have to use database. When somebody wants to register for the app, he provides all the information then these information is taken by the DB controller and saved in organized manner. same process occurs for all the other activities like adding self, adding item or login.

\subsection{Layer Hardware}

\subsection{Layer Software Dependencies}


\subsection{Subsystem 1}
Describe at a high level the purpose and basic design of this subsystem. Is it a piece of hardware, a class, a web service, or something else? Note that each of the subsystem items below are meant to be specific to that subsytem and not a repeat of anything discussed above for the overall layer.

\subsubsection{Subsystem Hardware}
A description of any involved hardware components for the subsystem.

\subsubsection{Subsystem Operating System}
A description of any operating systems required by the subsystem.

\subsubsection{Subsystem Software Dependencies}
A description of any software dependencies (libraries, frameworks, design software for mechanical parts or circuits, etc) required by the subsystem.

\subsubsection{Subsystem Programming Languages}
A description of any programming languages used by the subsystem.

\subsubsection{Subsystem Data Structures}
A description of any classes or other data structures that are worth discussing for the subsystem. For example, data being transmitted from a microcontroller to a PC via USB should be first be assembled into packets. What is the structure of the packets?

\subsubsection{Subsystem Data Processing}
A description of any algorithms or processing strategies that are worth discussing for the subsystem. If you are implementing a well-known algorithm, list it. If it is something unique to this project, discuss it in greater detail.
